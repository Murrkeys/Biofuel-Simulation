# Biofuel-Simulation

Project aims to create a simulation model of a biofuel production system.  The simulation is created using different design parameters.  Once the simulation is complete, the performance of the system is evaluated and the design parameters are chosen that maximize the amount of biofuel created. 

Scripts included : 

* sim_biofuel.py : Define a function that can be used to simulate the biofuel production process.

* find_max_and_oscillation.py : Define a function that finds the maximum amount of internal biofuel and the amount of oscillation in the level of internal biofuel.

* generate.py : Define a function that uses many different pairs of alpha_b and alpha_p to simulate the biofuel production

* Design.py : Define a function that chooses the best designs of alpha_b and alpha_p parameters based on the most external biofuel product.  The function chooses a best design based on threshold criteria and a poor design based only on output measures.
